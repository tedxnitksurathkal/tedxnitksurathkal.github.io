            "For those who aren’t just defined by their designations are the ones who set trails for others to follow. Had life not blossomed on the silver screen, Vishak Nair would have perhaps been busy with machines at a swanky corporate office. Vishak Nair is an Indian film and theatre actor, who is known for his work in the Malayalam industry. He made his acting debut in the coming-of-age romantic drama, Aanandam (2016) directed by Ganesh Raj which made him a household name. Vishak has starred in numerous movies following his debut endeavour. He is the also the Chief Operating Officer and Director of MadGenius productions.",
            "Vishak pursued Mechanical Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Karnataka (NITK) and graduated in 2014. During his time in NITK he actively took part in clubs such as NITK Music Club, Rotaract NITK, Dramatics Team and served as the President of the Toastmasters Club. Vishak worked for 2 years at Daimler India Commercial Vehicles in Chennai when he finally found his call into acting. Enough brilliance proving that he is the jack of all trades and master of many too."

            "A statement that comes as no surprise. By virtue of his academic ability, he enrolled as an engineering student. But it didn’t take him long to realize there were other callings worth fulfilling, and so he did. After founding his own campus T-shirt brand Annanymous, coining the term \"Ghanta Engineer\" and even selling chai in India’s silicon valley he realized that his story was one shared by millions. In true folktale fashion, he quit his job and set out to unravel the stories of India’s engineers.",

He came to the remote river island of Majuli to teach underprivileged children and later set up a school in the village of Kulamua at the request of the villagers. Armed with the help of the villagers who donated their lands, wood and manpower, the Hummingbird School was built.",

Sensing the need to extend their work with the community, along with his colleagues, he founded the Ayang trust. It works towards not only improving the education of the children there but also uplifting the local community by promoting a producer’s collective and working with women weavers to let them earn a livelihood."

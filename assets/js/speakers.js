      "Pranav Lal is a blind photographer. It almost sounds like an oxymoron, but he never lets his impairments stop him from trying things most of us would want to. Pranav suffered from Retinopathy of Prematurity at birth which resulted in him being completely blind ever since. However, this didn't stop the man from pursuing all that he was passionate about. Today, he is a cybersecurity professional who doubles up as a photographer. He is also an author of a blog 'Technesoterica' where he writes about technology related to sensory substitution.",
      "In 2001, he stumbled upon an augment reality device called vOICe. The software essentially converts images into sound which he heares through the headphones and determines what he is looking at. He once wrote a passage in his blog revealing, 'My tool of photography is the vOICe which allows me to both frame the subject and to experientially get a feel of how light is falling on a subject and how something will look.' Beyond being a master of one trade, Pranav is a self-taught programmer and continues to program as a hobby. He also loves to travel and has journeyed exclusivley in India, including trekking to the Himalayas."
